Pre-rendering and Data Fetching Summary

Pre-rendering refers to the process of generating HTML in advance which results in better
performance and SEO
Next JS supports two forms of pre-rendering Static Generation and Server Side rendering

Static Generation
A method of pre-rendering where the HTML pages are generated at build time
Pages can be built once, cached by a CDN and served to clients almost instantly
For a normal page, use getStaticProps function to fetch the data ahead of time
For a dynamic page, you need the getStaticPaths function
Pages cannot be updated without a full re-build so we opt to ISR (Incremental static regeneration)
e.g, marketing site, blogs

Server-side rendering
Fetch data at request time
Personalize data based on user information in the incoming request
getServerSideProps function helps with SSR data fetching
e.g News List paging
